(defelem circle
  "The <circle> SVG element is an SVG basic shape, used to create circles based
  on a center point and a radius.")

(defelem clipPath

  "The <clipPath> SVG element defines a clipping path. A clipping path is
  used/referenced using the clip-path property.

  The clipping path restricts the region to which paint can be applied.
  Conceptually, any parts of the drawing that lie outside of the region
  bounded by the currently active clipping path are not drawn.

  A clipping path is conceptually equivalent to a custom viewport for the
  referencing element. Thus, it affects the rendering of an element, but not
  the element's inherent geometry. The bounding box of a clipped element
  (meaning, an element which references a <clipPath> element via a clip-path
  property, or a child of the referencing element) must remain the same as if
  it were not clipped.

  By default, pointer-events must not be dispatched on the clipped
  (non-visible) regions of a shape. For example, a circle with a radius of 10
  which is clipped to a circle with a radius of 5 will not receive \"click\"
  events outside the smaller radius. Example:

    <svg width=\"120\" height=\"120\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\">
      <defs>
        <clipPath id=\"myClip\">
          <circle cx=\"30\" cy=\"30\" r=\"20\"/>
          <circle cx=\"70\" cy=\"70\" r=\"20\"/>

          clip-path=\"url(#myClip)\"/>
    </svg>")

(defelem color-profile
  "The <color-profile> element allows describing the color profile used for the
  image.")

(defelem defs
  "SVG allows graphical objects to be defined for later reuse. It is
  recommended that, wherever possible, referenced elements be defined inside
  of a <defs> element. Defining these elements inside of a <defs> element
  promotes understandability of the SVG content and thus promotes
  accessibility. Graphical elements defined in a <defs> element will not be
  directly rendered. You can use a <use> element to render those elements
  wherever you want on the viewport.")

(defelem desc
  "Each container element or graphics element in an SVG drawing can supply a
  description string using the <desc> element where the description is
  text-only.

  When the current SVG document fragment is rendered as SVG on visual media,
  <desc> elements are not rendered as part of the graphics. Alternate
  presentations are possible, both visual and aural, which display the <desc>
  element but do not display <path> elements or other graphics elements. The
  <desc> element generally improves accessibility of SVG documents.")

(defelem discard
  "The <discard> SVG element allows authors to specify the time at which
  particular elements are to be discarded, thereby reducing the resources
  required by an SVG user agent. This is particularly useful to help SVG
  viewers conserve memory while displaying long-running documents.

  The <discard> element may occur wherever the <animate> element may.")

(defelem ellipse
  "The ellipse element is an SVG basic shape, used to create ellipses based on
  a center coordinate, and both their x and y radius.

  Ellipses are unable to specify the exact orientation of the ellipse (if, for
  example, you wanted to draw an ellipse tilted at a 45 degree angle), but can
  be rotated by using the transform attribute.")

(defelem feBlend

  software when blending two layers. The mode is defined by the mode
  attribute.")

(defelem feColorMatrix
  "The <feColorMatrix> SVG filter element changes colors based on a
  transformation matrix. Every pixel's color value (represented by an
  [R,G,B,A] vector) is matrix multiplied to create a new color.")

(defelem feComponentTransform
  "The <feComponentTransfer> SVG filter primitive performs color-component-wise
  remapping of data for each pixel. It allows operations like brightness
  adjustment, contrast adjustment, color balance or thresholding.

  The calculations are performed on non-premultiplied color values. The colors
  are modified by changing each channel (R, G, B, and A) to the result of what
  the children <feFuncR>, <feFuncB>, <feFuncG>, and <feFuncA> return.")

(defelem feComposite

  "This filter primitive performs the combination of two input images
  pixel-wise in image space using one of the Porter-Duff compositing
  operations: over, in, atop, out, xor and lighter. Additionally, a
  component-wise arithmetic operation (with the result clamped between [0..1])
  can be applied.

  The arithmetic operation is useful for combining the output from the
  <feDiffuseLighting> and <feSpecularLighting> filters with texture data. If
  the arithmetic operation is chosen, each result pixel is computed using the
  following formula:

    result = k1*i1*i2 + k2*i1 + k3*i2 + k4

  where:

    * i1 and i2 indicate the corresponding pixel channel values of the input
      image, which map to in and in2 respectively

    * k1, k2, k3 and k4 indicate the values of the attributes with the same
      name")

(defelem feConvolveMatrix
  "The <feConvolveMatrix> SVG filter primitive applies a matrix convolution
  filter effect. A convolution combines pixels in the input image with
  neighboring pixels to produce a resulting image. A wide variety of imaging
  operations can be achieved through convolutions, including blurring, edge
  detection, sharpening, embossing and beveling.")

(defelem feDiffuseLighting
  "The <feDiffuseLighting> SVG filter primitive lights an image using the alpha
  channel as a bump map. The resulting image, which is an RGBA opaque image,
  depends on the light color, light position and surface geometry of the input
  bump map.

  The light map produced by this filter primitive can be combined with a
  texture image using the multiply term of the arithmetic operator of the
  <feComposite> filter primitive. Multiple light sources can be simulated by
  adding several of these light maps together before applying it to the
  texture image.")

(defelem feDisplacementMap
  "The <feDisplacementMap> SVG filter primitive uses the pixel values from the
  image from in2 to spatially displace the image from in.

  The formula for the transformation looks like this:

    P'(x,y) ‚Üê P( x + scale * (XC(x,y) - 0.5), y + scale * (YC(x,y) - 0.5))

  where P(x,y) is the input image, in, and P'(x,y) is the destination. XC(x,y)
  and YC(x,y) are the component values of the channel designated by
  xChannelSelector and yChannelSelector.")

  red component of the input graphic of its parent <feComponentTransfer>
  element.")

(defelem feGaussianBlur
  "The <feGaussianBlur> SVG filter primitive blurs the input image by the
  amount specified in stdDeviation, which defines the bell-curve.")

(defelem feImage
  "The <feImage> SVG filter primitive fetches image data from an external
  source and provides the pixel data as output (meaning if the external source
  is an SVG image, it is rasterized.)")

(defelem feMerge
  "The <feMerge> SVG element allows filter effects to be applied concurrently
  instead of sequentially. This is achieved by other filters storing their
  output via the result attribute and then accessing it in a <feMergeNode>
  child.")

(defelem feMergeNode
  "The feMergeNode takes the result of another filter to be processed by its
  parent <feMerge>.")

(defelem feMorphology
  "The <feMorphology> SVG filter primitive is used to erode or dilate the input
  image. It's usefulness lies especially in fattening or thinning effects.")

  "The <fePointLight> SVG filter primitive allows to create a point light
  effect.")

(defelem feSpecularLighting
  "The <feSpecularLighting> SVG filter primitive lights a source graphic using
  the alpha channel as a bump map. The resulting image is an RGBA image based
  on the light color. The lighting calculation follows the standard specular
  component of the Phong lighting model. The resulting image depends on the
  light color, light position and surface geometry of the input bump map. The
  result of the lighting calculation is added. The filter primitive assumes
  that the viewer is at infinity in the z direction.

  This filter primitive produces an image which contains the specular reflection
  part of the lighting calculation. Such a map is intended to be combined with
  a texture using the add term of the arithmetic <feComposite> method.
  Multiple light sources can be simulated by adding several of these light
  maps before applying it to the texture image.")

(defelem feSpotLight
  "The <feSpotLight> SVG filter primitive allows to create a spotlight effect.")

(defelem feTile

  repeated, tiled pattern of an input image. The effect is similar to the one
  of a <pattern>.")

(defelem feTurbulence

  clouds or marble. The resulting image will fill the entire filter primitive
  subregion.")

(defelem filter

(defelem foreignObject
  "The <foreignObject> SVG element allows for inclusion of a foreign XML
  namespace which has its graphical content drawn by a different user agent.
  The included foreign graphical content is subject to SVG transformations and
  compositing.

  The contents of foreignObject are assumed to be from a different namespace.
  Any SVG elements within a foreignObject will not be drawn, except in the
  situation where a properly defined SVG subdocument with a proper xmlns
  attribute specification is embedded recursively. One situation where this
  can occur is when an SVG document fragment is embedded within another
  non-SVG document fragment, which in turn is embedded within an SVG document
  fragment (e.g., an SVG document fragment contains an XHTML document fragment
  which in turn contains yet another SVG document fragment).

  Usually, a foreignObject will be used in conjunction with the <switch>

  user agent support and provide an alternate rendering in case user agent
  support is not available.")

(defelem g

(defelem title
  "Each container element or graphics element in an SVG drawing can supply a
  <title> element containing a description string where the description is
  text-only. When the current SVG document fragment is rendered as SVG on
  visual media, <title> element is not rendered as part of the graphics.
  However, some user agents may, for example, display the <title> element as a
  tooltip. Alternate presentations are possible, both visual and aural, which
  display the <title> element but do not display path elements or other
  graphics elements. The <title> element generally improve accessibility of
  SVG documents

  Generally <title> element should be the first child element of its parent.
  Note that those implementations that do use <title> to display a tooltip
  often will only do so if the <title> is indeed the first child element of
  its parent.")

(defelem ^:deprecated tref
  "The textual content for a <text> SVG element can be either character data
  directly embedded within the <text> element or the character data content of
  a referenced element, where the referencing is specified with a <tref>
  element.")

(defelem tspan
  "Within a <text> element, text and font properties and the current text
  position can be adjusted with absolute or relative coordinate values by
  including a <tspan> element.")

(defelem unknown
  "TODO")

(defelem use
  "The <use> element takes nodes from within the SVG document, and duplicates
  them somewhere else. The effect is the same as if the nodes were deeply
  cloned into a non-exposed DOM, and then pasted where the use element is,
  much like cloned template elements in HTML5. Since the cloned nodes are not
  exposed, care must be taken when using CSS to style a use element and its
  hidden descendants. CSS attributes are not guaranteed to be inherited by the
  hidden, cloned DOM unless you explicitly request it using CSS inheritance.

  For security reasons, some browsers could apply a same-origin policy on use
  elements and could refuse to load a cross-origin URI within the xlink:href
  attribute.")
